Scenario: Building a Simple Retail Data Vault with Databricks

Imagine a large retail company with various data sources:

Point-of-sale (POS) transactions capturing customer purchases, items, and prices.

Inventory management system tracking stock levels and movements.

Customer loyalty program data with member information and purchase history.

They want to build a data vault in Databricks to centralize, integrate, and transform this data for various analytics needs.

Data Vault Design

The data vault adheres to the following principles:

Hubs: Store slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) like customers, products, and stores. Hubs have unique identifiers (primary keys) and historical data (effective dates).

Satellites: Contain detailed factual data from source systems linked to hub records using foreign keys.

Links: (Optional) Denormalized tables that connect hubs for faster querying specific relationships (e.g., customer purchases in a specific store).



Note: This is a basic example. Real-world implementations would involve more complex transformations, error handling, schema validation, and potentially additional hubs and satellites.



Benefits of this Approach:

Centralized Data: Data is stored in a single location for easy access by various analytics tools.

Improved Data Quality: Transformations can clean and standardize data across sources.



Historical Analysis: SCDs allow for analyzing trends over time.

Flexibility: The data vault structure is scalable to accommodate new data sources and dimensions.
